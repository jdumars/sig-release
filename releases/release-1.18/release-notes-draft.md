## Urgent Upgrade Notes

### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- Action required
  1. Currently, if users were to explicitly specify CacheSize of 0 for KMS provider, they would end-up with a provider that caches up to 1000 keys. This PR changes this behavior.
  Post this PR, when users supply 0 for CacheSize this will result in a validation error.
  
  2. CacheSize type was changed from int32 to *int32. This allows defaulting logic to differentiate between cases where users explicitly supplied 0 vs. not supplied any value.
  3. KMS Provider's endpoint (path to Unix socket) is now validated when the EncryptionConfiguration files is loaded. This used to be handled by the GRPCService. ([#85363](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85363), [@immutableT](https://github.com/immutableT)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth and Instrumentation]

- The StreamingProxyRedirects feature and `--redirect-container-streaming` flag are deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. The default behavior (proxy streaming requests through the kubelet) will be the only supported option.
  If you are setting `--redirect-container-streaming=true`, then you must migrate off this configuration. The flag will no longer be able to be enabled starting in v1.20. If you are not setting the flag, no action is necessary. ([#88290](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/88290), [@tallclair](https://github.com/tallclair)) [SIG API Machinery and Node]
