The Test Infra role was deprecated at the end of the Kubernetes 1.15 release cycle.
Beginning with the Kubernetes 1.16 release cycle, the duties of the Test Infra role have been spread across the following:
- Release Managers, specifically to the [Branch Manager](/release-engineering/role-handbooks/branch-manager.md)
- [Test Infra On-call (SIG Testing)](https://go.k8s.io/oncall) (#testing-ops and #sig-testing on Slack)
