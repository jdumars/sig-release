# Kubernetes Release Team: Release Notes

## Overview:

The Release Notes role is responsible for collecting and fine-tuning release-notes from the many contributions to Kubernetes between release cycles. This role is likely to find that work during the first several weeks of the release cycle is very laid back with the bulk of the tasks being completed at the end, once the release is firmed up.

The release lead will be responsible for introducing shadows to the team and the release notes tool and may ask shadows to run it and make the update PRâ€™s. The release notes lead should indicate pain points and known issues to the shadows (if there are any) and work on strategies for overcoming them to avoid their coalescence during the later weeks. 

If there are potential fixes to the issues indicated and team members are keen, fixes and automation of the process is very welcome but not expected.

## Prerequisites for Release Notes Lead and Shadows

### General Requirements

**Before continuing on to the Release Notes specific requirements listed below, please review and work through the tasks in the [Release Team Onboarding Guide](/release-team/release-team-onboarding.md).**

### Skills and Experience Requirements:

* Strong written and verbal communications skills
* A working knowledge of Kubernetes concepts
* Project management experience is helpful but not required

### Time Requirements:

Compared to other release team roles, release notes is one of the least time
intensive roles.

#### Early and mid release cycle (weeks 1-8) ~1-5 hours/week

In the first 8 weeks of the cycle, the Release Notes team should/must, attend weekly release meetings and run the [release-notes tool](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/tree/master/cmd/release-notes) as well as update the [release-notes website](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/release-notes) for every `alpha`, `beta` and `rc` to create an early draft of the release notes. This ensures that the overall quality of the release notes can be verified from the beginning of the release cycle.

#### Late release cycle (weeks 9-12+) ~4-10 hours/week
This period has an increase in release team  meetings each week and there is
also significantly more work to do to ensure the release notes are in good
working order for the release.

Once code freeze begins, the release notes draft
is transferred to a Google Doc which is made public to the Kubernetes community.
The doc will be edited by SIG leads and SIG members but will also be edited for
grammar and uniform style by the release notes team. 

The Release Notes team should use the [template](relnotes-template.md) to organize the raw generated release notes in the Google doc as best as possible and help to guide SIG leads and members in their further editing of the release notes. The final edited release notes should follow this
template. 

The release notes tool must continue to be run on the release branch (for `beta` and `rc` releases) in order to pull in any outstanding PRs that are merged between the
beginning of code freeze and the release.

## Tasks

- The Release Notes Lead and Shadows attend burn down meetings, SIG Release meetings and follow the [#sig-release](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/C2C40FMNF) Slack channel for relevant information throughout the release cycle.
- One member of the Release Notes Team should be responsible for [setting up and running](setup-tool.md) the [release-notes tool](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/tree/master/cmd/release-notes) to collect generated drafts of all release-notes identified in the current release -- improvements to the tool are always welcome!
- Drafts produced by the tool are copied to a file called `release-notes-draft.md` in the [releases folder](../../../releases) for the current release in the `sig-release` repo.
- The [release-notes website](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/release-notes)
  should be updated together with the markdown based version: The website uses the
  JSON output from the release-notes tool to render it online. We publish the
  intermediate version directly to the `master` branch to reflect the current
  state. For this, the currently deployed release notes have to be preserved.
  Contributions and enhancements to the website are very welcome, whereas the
  feature planning and bug tracking happens directly in the GitHub repository. A
  note to this deployment will be added to the final manually edited release
  notes markdown document.
- The team is responsible for adding Patch Release (e.g. 1.15.1, etc.) notes to the website. The [procedure for producing Patch Release notes](patch-notes.md) is slightly different than generating the release notes Drafts.
- The Communications team will hold meetings to discuss blogposts and media releases regarding the release sometime before code freeze. Ensure that at least one person from the release notes team attends this meeting with the release lead and enhancements lead. The release notes team should ensure that the "Major Themes" identified in this meeting are reflected in the "Major Themes" section of the release notes. If no one is able to attend the meeting, reach out to the communications team, release lead or enhancements lead to ensure messaging around Major Themes is coordinated.
- If gentle nudging of SIG Leads is not effective in retrieving feedback/confirmation, the Release Notes Team can use a reasonable amount of creative liberty in completing the notes
- A ["Known Issues Umbrella Issue"](known-issues-bucket.md) for the release must be created by the release notes team in [kubernetes/kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/new) so issues can be collected for the "Known Issues" section of the release notes.
- The confirmed upon notes are cleaned up and copy edited by the release-notes team to ensure uniform language/style is used.
- An "External Dependencies" section should be curated which outlines how external dependency versions have changed since the last release
  - See [the 1.12 release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.12.md#external-dependencies) for an example
	- Note that there are [plans in the process to formalize and automate the process of aggregating the changes](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2234), but this is currently [a very manual process](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/pull/398).
  - To update an entry in this section the following steps must be performed:
    - Pick an entry, for example "Default etcd server was updated to v3.2.24. (#68318)"
    - Open the linked PR 68318 and find which files and lines it modifies
    - Open the same files in the `kubernetes/kubernetes` master branch and see if the version changed from v3.2.24
    - Look at the history of the file and find which commit / PR changed the version
    - Update the entry with the new version and PR URL
    - Update the entry message accordingly - if the version has changed or it has been preserved between versions
  - The website [lwkd.info](http://lwkd.info/) has weekly Kubernetes updates that often include information about changes in dependencies under a "Version Updates" section
- Kubernetes is released with the completed notes!

### Post 1.17 TODOs

#### If any team members have NLP experience:
- Implement functionality in release-notes tool to automatically process language in generated release notes file
  Goals:
    - Generate uniform style across release notes (ie. past tense, formatting)
    - Decrease copy editing time

## Release Milestone Activities:

- Create [known issues issue](known-issues-bucket.md) in `kubernetes/kubernetes` to capture known issues for the release

- Send [an email to SIG-leads](sig-leads-email.md) to capture major themes from their SIG
- Start determining major themes for release notes template to send to SIG-leads

### Week 10
